# Data Communications and Computer Networks

## Course Objectives

The main objectives of the course are:
1. To learn the basic principles behind the interconnection between different hosts across private, organizational and public networks.
2. To learn to develop programs for data communication on various network layers and understand the security concepts on these layers.

## Course Description

The course is designed to teach the principles of networking by using protocol layering of the internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite. The topics flow in bottom-up approach. The learner shall understand how bits move in physical layer before learning how programs exchange messages at application layer. The learner shall complete 10 quizzes, 4 assignments, 1 semester Project, regular examinations and topic based problem sets. Moreover, the learner will work through Lab Assignments, Programming Assignments and Simulation Experiments throughout the course.

## Course Outcomes

1. The learner shall learn to design the network of IPv4 and IPv6 for interconnecting various network components at different layers.
2. The learner shall learn to configure various data communication strategies for maintaining Quality of Service while securing the network at different layers.
3. The learner shall learn different tools and strategies for securing the network environment
